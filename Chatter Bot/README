=============================
The ChatterBot will reply to sentences that it gets according to the first word of the current statement.
If the statement start with "say" (or any other word that the user can choose), then the bot will reply
accordingly with random reply from its "legal" replies stack,
otherwise it will choose a random reply from its "iilegal" replies stack.

=  Implementation details   =
=============================
The ChatterBot has 3 mainly fields - * name - name of the bot (like Siri),
                                     * repliesToIllegalRequest - the replies that the bot will return if the
                                     statement does not start with the REQUEST_PREFIX (like "say")
                                     * repliesToLegalRequest - the replies that the bot will return in case
                                     that he doesn't recognize the statement.(not start with REQUEST_PREFIX)
ChatterBot also has 2 mainly methods - * replyTo - which checks if the request is legal or illegal and uses
                                       another methods to reply accordingly.
                                       * getName - which returns the name of the bot.
3 important constants:
REQUEST_PREFIX - the magic prefix that will be the first prefix of a legal request, can be determined by user
REQUESTED_PHRASE_PLACEHOLDER - used for smart legal replies of the bot (switched by the received statement)
ILLEGAL_REQUEST_PLACEHOLDER - used for smart illegal replies of the bot (switched by the received statement)
